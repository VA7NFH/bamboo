# Bamboo
Nozzle flow and cooling dynamics using perfect gas equations for 1D isentropic flow.

## Installation
`pip install git+https://github.com/cuspaceflight/bamboo.git`

## Currently includes
- Nozzle shape calculator for Rao bell nozzles.
- Get thrust and specific impulse.
- Get gas properties (temperature and pressure) as a function of position in the nozzle.
- Estimate apogee using a simple 1D trajectory simulator.
- Optimise nozzle area ratio based on the simple trajectory simulator.
- Tools for modelling engine cooling systems.
