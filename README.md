Nozzle flow dynamics using perfect gas equations for 1D isentropic flow  

The intention is that the library uses as many analytical (as opposed to numerical) methods as possible, so the code can run quickly and can be used for optimisation and design studies.

The idea is that the code runs quickly, just like bamboo grows quickly (very creative, I know).
